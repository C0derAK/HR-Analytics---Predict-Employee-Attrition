üß≠ Step-by-Step Power BI Process
Step 1: Prepare Data

Use the cleaned dataset (hr_data.csv after model preprocessing).
If needed, export important summary data (e.g., feature importance, confusion matrix results) from Python:

# Example to export feature importance
import pandas as pd
importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Importance': tree.feature_importances_
})
importance.to_csv("artifacts/feature_importance.csv", index=False)


Then import both:

hr_data.csv

artifacts/feature_importance.csv

Step 2: Load into Power BI

Open Power BI Desktop.

Click Get Data ‚Üí Text/CSV ‚Üí hr_data.csv.

Load data into the report.

Use the Model view to ensure relationships (if using multiple files).

Step 3: Create Visuals

Go to Report View.

Add a title box (‚ÄúEmployee Attrition Insights‚Äù).

Insert cards ‚Üí Total Employees, Attrition Count, etc.
Example DAX:

Attrition Count = COUNTROWS(FILTER(HR_Data, HR_Data[Attrition] = "Yes"))
Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Attrition Count], COUNTROWS(HR_Data)) * 100


Add the charts as described in the layout table above.

Add slicers (filters) for department, gender, education level.

Step 4: Add Predictive Insights

Import the feature importance CSV (artifacts/feature_importance.csv).

Use a bar chart to show the top predictors.

Optionally add screenshots from Python SHAP plots (artifacts/shap_summary.html ‚Üí take a screenshot).
